# 👋 Hey, I'm Sahand

I'm a backend engineer passionate about building robust, scalable infrastructure and software. I have worked predominantly in Java (learning Go and Rust expeditiously -- check out some of my projects!), and I love working at the intersection of infrastructure, cloud, and security. 

When I'm not coding I like to cook, learn about culture and history, travel, and spend my time outdoors exploring colorful Colorado.
