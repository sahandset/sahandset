# 👋 Hey, I'm Sahand

I'm a backend engineer passionate about building robust, scalable infrastructure and software. I have worked predominantly in Java (learning Go and Rust expeditiously -- check out some of my projects!), and I love working at the intersection of infrastructure, cloud, and security.
